                Hi. I'm Conor. Thank you for taking the time to visit my website!
            </p>
            <p>
                I have recently completed a 4 year course in B.Sc. of Computer Applications in DCU, where i received 2.2 honours.
                Last year as part of my course i completed a 6 month  work placement, spent in an established IT firm.
                I gained experience in a variety of areas including development, testing and support.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have a passion for producing well written, efficient code and am always working towards improving my development skills,
                through coursework and in personal projects.
                I love being challenged and pride myself on being able to adapt quickly to new technologies & environments.
            </p>
            <p>
                The numerous college assignments completed over my time in DCU, coupled with my work placement, have enhanced my productivity working either as part of a team or independently.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am currently seeking graduate opportunities in Software Development.

                    <b>What it does</b><br>

                    WhichPrep is an educational application developed for Android.
                    It aims to aid the user, typically a non-native English speaker, in their use of prepositional words in sentences.
                    This is the main area in which people learning the English language have difficulty with.<br><br>

                    The app tests the user by presenting them with a series of sentences missing the prepositional word.
                    These sentences are scraped dynamically from articles on the web,
                    ensuring the user is never tested on the same question twice.
                    The user can either choose the correct word from a list of three choices,
                    or use the phones microphone to speak the word they feel is correct.<br><br>

                    The app analyzes user choice and time spent per question and through this provides informative feedback and identifies weaknesses
                    so as to improve the users use of the English language.<br><br>
