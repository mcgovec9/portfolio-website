Website is pretty much complete, the only thing lacking is that it isnt the most responsive. So on some smaller screens (mobiles, tablets) there are some issues. On any desktop screen everything should be ok. 

At a later stage i may add functionality for a more responsive design but for now i thinks it's ok. I wasn't too worried about making it more mobile friendly when i started as i feel the majority of views of the site will be from a desktop device.
