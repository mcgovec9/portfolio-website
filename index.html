                LCD Soundsystem began by releasing a string of singles under DFA Records, which was co-founded by band frontman James Murphy.[6] They gained attention with their first single, "Losing My Edge", which peaked at number 115 in the UK.[7] Described as "an eight-minute, laugh-out-loud funny dissection of cool over a dirty electronic beat";[8] the single became an underground dance favorite. This was followed by the single "Give It Up", and in the following year, "Yeah" and "Movement". The latter two peaked at number 77 and number 52 in the UK, respectively.[7]

                LCD Soundsystem released their eponymous debut studio album in January 2005 to critical acclaim.[9] For the CD version, the first disc contains the album and the second contains a compilation of previous singles.[10] They later released the single "Daft Punk Is Playing at My House" the following month, which became their first UK top 40 hit, peaking at number 29,[7] as well as their most commercially successful single, charting in Australia,[11] Belgium,[12] and the Netherlands.[13] The band toured with M.I.A. following the release of the album.[14]

                In June 2005, the band covered a Siouxsie and the Banshees song, "Slowdive" for the B-side of their single "Disco Infiltrator".[15]

                In December 2005, the group received nominations for two Grammy nominations, one for Best Electronic/Dance Album with their self-titled album and one for Best Dance Recording with "Daft Punk Is Playing at My House."[16] Their self-titled debut was also placed at number 94 of Amazon.com's "Top 100 Editor's Picks" of 2005.[17]
                In October 2006, LCD Soundsystem released a composition entitled "45:33", as part of Nike's Original Run series. It was made available for download from iTunes.[18] Despite its name, the track is actually 45 minutes and 58 seconds long—the title is a reference to vinyl speeds (33 and 45 RPM)[18]—and was claimed to "reward and push at good intervals of a run".[19] However, it was later revealed that this was not the case, but that Murphy merely wanted the opportunity to create a long piece of music, akin to E2-E4 by Manuel Göttsching.[20]

                LCD Soundsystem's second studio album, Sound of Silver, was released on March 20, 2007, to universal critical acclaim.[21] Praise included Mixmag awarding it the title Album of the Month, a 9.2 score from Pitchfork[22] and a 5-star review from The Guardian.[23] The album release was preceded by the single "North American Scum", which was released in February 2007.[24]
                On March 5, 2013, LCD Soundsystem was named one of Rolling Stone’s New Immortals—"currently active (or relatively recently defunct) artists who [they] think will stand the test of time." [55] On April 19, 2014, the definitive live recording of the farewell show, The Long Goodbye: LCD Soundsystem Live at Madison Square Garden, was released in a 5-box vinyl edition.
